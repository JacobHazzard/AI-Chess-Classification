# AI-Chess-Classification

In a game of chess, there are many situations that can force a win or guarantee a loss. Among these factors, the orientation of the pieces is crucial to strategy. Along with orientation, the value of the remaining pieces and their move-set is critical when planning a checkmate, which triggers a win scenario. Based on these configurations, we can determine the probability of the result being classified as ‘won’ or ‘nowin’. Several models were created to classify the final result from this dataset, the best by far being a decision tree which had the best performance score in all measured metrics, along with being the quickest.
